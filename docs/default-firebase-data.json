      "content": "DevFest Galway was announced, for the sixth year in a row, the conference will bring together 900 developers, managers and entrepreneurs on **October 13-14** to Lviv.  This year our team is doing big advancement in the content, we're building an extra stage to accommodate more visitors and provide three fully independent tracks on Android, Web and Google Cloud topics.  Our focus is the content. **We’re looking for speakers like you**, who are ready to rock the stage and deliver the best talk or workshop in the field.  \"I've been to conferences all over the world and what you've created in Lviv is world class. It's easily first league of conferences.\" - Piotr Tuszynski, DevFest '16 Keynote Speaker  <div layout horizontal center-justified> <a href=\"http://bit.ly/df17-c4p\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">   <paper-button primary>Submit a proposal</paper-button> </a> </div>  ## Why is it cool to speak at the DevFest?  DevFest Ukraine is not an ordinary tech conference, besides selecting only the best speakers, we help them to succeed in delivering an exceptional quality talk on the stage.  Here are few perks that all our speakers get:  - **Expences covered**. Hotel for 3 nights, travel costs and entrance to exclusive speaker parties are covered for all speakers. - **Professional video recording**. We work with experienced video production companies to create session recording of the best quality. Stage, screen, audio, all is recorded separately and combined later. Check the [session videos from the last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOwUnBkqmo4). - **Exposure**. By being a speaker, you are proving your level of expertise to a potential business partners or employers. Your talk will be promoted in our online resources and recording published in YouTube channel with more than 35k views. - **Unique networking**. Being a speaker means you’ll have the unique chance to network with other speakers - the best experts in the industry. - **Coaching**. We're in the same boat, after being selected as a speaker our program committee will help you to deliver the best talk possible. We provide information about the audience, presentation templates, feedback on the slides, all to help you to prepare.  \"It was a best DevFest I ever attended. So professional, so much enthusiasm from the community. You managed to bring the vibe of Google I/O to Ukraine.\" - David Vávra, DevFest '16 Speaker  ## What are we looking for?  We're looking for **experience-based talks**, the information that can not be found in the documentation or easily googled. We're looking for your stories, your struggles, research results and experiences with the frontier tools or technologies. Check the [list of topics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18eGvBr6wdlXsfiZM4EK6SubfL3G1RWj-ABTBN9pngNg/edit?usp=sharing) we're interested in (it is not full and updated all the time).  ### Format  You can submit as many talks as you want. This year we accept submissions in two formats:   - 40 minutes sessions.   - 2(or 3) hours workshops.  ### Talks that will not pass initial review  - Talks about a specific tool/library/project explaining how it works or how to use it.  - Talks whose focus is pitching a company or project. It’s cool that you mention your company during the presentation, but it shouldn’t be the focus of the talk.  - Proposals that are not in English.  - Recruitment talks to attract talent.  We strongly recommend you check out [speaking.io](http://speaking.io/) website from Zach Holman. It includes good tips and guidelines for speakers.   ## Timeline  **Call for Papers submission deadline is July 1, 2017.** Submission results will be announced by July 16.   Any questions?

In this talk, we are going to discuss the basic concepts around ML and using high-level libraries in JavaScript to implement on our project. Described as a friendly Machine Learning library ml5.js will be our entry door to the Machine Learning world. To wrap up the introduction journey, we will see how we can use ml5.js in a real project.

The talk progresses into more real world complex situations and how it is being built now. The second part of the talk introduces the audience to Augmented Reality and when its is useful and when not. What it means to build a Mixed Reality experience. The present hardware and software stack available for it. And what they need to know if they have to build an experience. The talk will also cover ARKit, ARCore and finally the WebXR api and how we can ensure a uniform codebase that works everywhere enabling a Web Mixed Reality that can run in any device and browser with native capability. The talk ends with open research problems for Future work and how they can use this today and contribute in future.

Digital agencies, news portal, startups and now Consultants, I've worked with different types of companies and I brought different experience from them. My strongest is client-side front-end development. Moreover, My main domains are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, Compass, Angular and React. On server-side, I usually code in Java and PHP. Originally from Brazil, currently, I'm based in Ireland living a new challenge, working with .NET e Umbraco a new platform different than what I was working before. But my belief is: if you understand the bases and the process behind each technology, you will be able to jump between different platforms. In 2010 He attended his first WordCamp as a volunteer, 4 years later became WordCamp organizer. Since attended his first WordCamp, he already participated as a speaker in 10 more WordCamps in South America and Europe, Always talking about his favourite subject: front-end and Google technologies. Work with communities is one of my passions, in 2014 I had the chance to work as a community manager on Blackberry mobile dev group. Blackberry was my first experience with a multinational company and there I had the chance to guide 10 students and work directly with the developer community in Sao Paulo.",

He switched from Symbian to Android in early 2009 (before Android versions had tasty names) and never looked back. He loves public speaking, and has presented at several DroidCons and Game Developer Conferences. After working a lot on front end – especially building games – Raul has developed a special interest in UX and UI. His current favourite topic is Playful Design. He also maintains the Leonids library, which is a particle system for standard Android UI. While living in Amsterdam, Raul was actively involved in Appsterdam and the DutchAUG. Since moving back to Dublin, he now collaborates with the Dublin GDG.",
